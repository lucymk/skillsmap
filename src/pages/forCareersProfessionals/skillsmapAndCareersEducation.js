          In this section we share some ideas about how you can use SkillsMap®
          as part of your careers education programme.

          <summary>Using SkillsMap® in a careers session</summary>
          <p>
            SkillsMap® has been designed to be used independently by learners,
            but our platform testing shows that it’s most effective when used in
            a structured way and led by a careers professional. Educators can
            also use this approach if they are using SkillsMap® directly with
            learners.
          </p>
          <p>We suggest that the first time you use it you might like to:</p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              Introduce SkillsMap® by sharing or showing{' '}
              <InternalLink to="../forLearners">the video</InternalLink>
            </li>
            <li>
              Go to the <InternalLink to="../">homepage</InternalLink> and ask
              learners to click on the SkillsMap® search function
            </li>
            <li>
              On the Subject selection page, suggest that first time around
              learners choose just one subject to search, for example their
              favourite subject
            </li>
            <li>
              Selecting a subject reveals 15 transferable skills developed in
              that subject. You could encourage them to click on the different
              skills for themselves and get the workplace examples
            </li>
            <li>
              You could ask learners to share back their responses to the skills
              list for their chosen subject with some structured reflective
              questions such as:
              <ul>
                <li>What were your responses to seeing the list?</li>
                <li>Which skills were you surprised to see in the list?</li>
                <li>Which workplace examples interested you?</li>
                <li>
                  Which skills do you recognise that you might already know you
                  are using?
                </li>
                <li>Which skills seem less familiar?</li>
                <li>
                  Which of the skills do they enjoy using in their studies or
                  other situations?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Which of the skills do they think they might also be using in
                  their hobbies, volunteering, caring responsibilities or
                  part-time work?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              You could also ask learners to pick one skill from a subject they
              enjoy and then reflect on:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When they use this skill in the subject – can they recall a
                  class or piece of homework where they have been using this
                  skill?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Can they think of other examples of how that skill might be
                  used in a workplace role or sector?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              You could then encourage learners to return to the Subject page
              and select another subject they are studying and search again
            </li>
            <li>
              You could also encourage them to return to the Subject page and
              select more than one subject if they would like to. When they see
              the combination of skills common to 2 or 3 subjects, you could ask
              them:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Are you surprised to see that these subjects have skills in
                  common?
                </li>
                <li>
                  When do you think you use this skills in each of the subjects
                  you chose?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How does the skill seem different in each of those subjects?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How does the skill seem similar in each of those subjects?
                </li>
              </ul>

          <summary>Benchmark 4: Linking Curriculum to Careers</summary>
          <p>
            The majority of schools in England are required to meet the
            government’s statutory guidance about careers education, including
            Benchmark 4, Linking Curriculum to Careers. This can be a huge
            challenge for schools, particularly when trying to connect subjects
            in humanities or social sciences which don’t have obvious linear
            career outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            SkillsMap® changes the understanding of the relationship between
            curriculum and careers completely because, unlike other skills
            platforms, it is based on the premise that all subjects are
            connected to careers because they all develop transferable skills.
            Rather than adding in a small number of skills to curriculum,
            SkillsMap® evidences the significant number of transferable skills
            that are already being developed in every subject area. While not
            all those skills are shown in SkillsMap® it helps get the
            conversation started in your school or college. Using SkillsMap®
            might help you find different ways to create careers education to
            meet Benchmark 4.

          <p>
            Have you ever wondered how to explain to learners what the subjects
            they study at school or college have to do with work and their

          </p>
          <BulletList>

              When we identify and talk about the transferable skills that are
              developed when learners learn different subjects we:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Start giving them some language for the skills they are

                </li>
                <li>
                  Start giving them a way to connect the subjects they study to
                  the jobs and careers they might be interested in, through the
                  common factor of transferable Skills
                </li>
                <li>
                  Start giving them a way to look at their own strengths and

                  curriculum to extra-curricular activities including hobbies,

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifying and talking about skills and subjects in this way
              opens up valuable conversations for learners about the value of
              education, particularly when they might be struggling to engage,
              or be worrying about the future
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Have you ever tried to explain how a subject a learner really loves
            at school or college will have future use to them in the workplace?
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              Narratives that focus on ‘good’ and ‘bad’ or ‘right’ and ‘wrong’
              choices of subject are generally focused on the alignment (or lack
              of it) of subject knowledge with future career choices. For some
              degree subjects and career paths that is true, but not in the
              majority of cases
            </li>
            <li>
              Helping learners see their qualifications as also developing
              transferable skills means that learners can continue to really
              enjoy their chosen subjects, without feeling that they are
              compromising their future job and career choices or their
              potential for employment
            </li>
            <li>
              In fact, employers really want to hear about learners who have a
              passion for their subjects, because it shows commitment and depth
              of interest
            </li>
            <li>
              And employers also like to hear that learners understand the wider
              value of those subjects, in terms of the transferable skills that
              they seek
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversations about combinations of subjects, particularly
              post-16, become easier when learners understand the skills that
              are developed in different subjects, and how those skills surface
              in different subjects:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For example, subjects in the same discipline (e.g. humanities)
                  will develop similar transferable skills
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learners taking subjects from across different disciplines
                  will develop a wider range of transferable skills
                </li>
                <li>
                  And some subjects which are often seen as less traditional
                  actually develop significantly more transferable skills than
                  more traditional subjects
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            Have you tried to explain to learners what value their
            qualifications have to employers?
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              Qualifications are often spoken of and defined in terms of the
              knowledge that learners gain
            </li>
            <li>
              But when we show learners that they also develop transferable
              skills through their qualifications, we break down the idea that
              what they study is only connected to future choices through
              knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
              This breaks down the idea of careers being a linear consequence of
              subject choices, which is really important for all learners,
              including:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  learners wanting to explore different areas (e.g. moving from
                  languages to tech)
                </li>
                <li>
                  learners in humanities worried about the future value of those
                  subjects
                </li>
                <li>
                  learners who are struggling to see the future value of
                  subjects that are incorrectly perceived as less academic (e.g.
                  media studies or physical education) but which actually
                  develop a far wider range of transferable skills than more
                  conventional subjects
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Alongside transferable skills, subject study and qualifications
              also develop attributes (behaviours, qualities and values) and
              experience in learners, as well as knowledge. At SkillsMap®,
              that’s how we define employability [link to Research &
              Publications]. When learners understand that, they can make more
              sense of how their qualifications will help prepare them for all
              the futures they might be interested in.

          <summary>Transferable Skills and Careers Guidance</summary>
          <p>
            Careers guidance is just one element of a school or college Careers
            Education programme, which will include interaction with employers,
            enrichment and co-curricular activities, cross-school projects, and
            sometimes curriculum elements too. Learners can sometimes struggle
            to connect what is meaningful to them with these other areas of
            activity, let alone to their education. Conversations that connect
            the principles of guidance, the learner’s experience of curriculum
            and transferable skills together can help bring coherence to all of
            these activities across a programme, and create added value for
            learners, Careers Professionals and educators.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of careers guidance often starts with helping learners
            identify their passions, values, interests and hobbies. SkillsMap®
            supports that approach by:
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>
              recognising that those transferable skills underpin passions,
              values, interests and hobbies, making connections between
              apparently different areas of their lives that are meaningful to
              learners as well as connecting to their education
            </li>
            <li>
              helping learners identify how their subject study is helping them
              develop skills they will use in a wide range of future careers and
              jobs
            </li>
            <li>
              putting names to the skills that they are developing and enjoying
              using
            </li>
            <li>
              reassuring learners that when it comes to subject choices, all
              subjects open up opportunities, even in the context of specific
              higher education requirements (e.g. for health sciences,
              engineering etc.)
            </li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            You could use these reflective points as part of a conversation with
            your learners.
          </p>

        <Details>
          <summary>Connecting to future careers and jobs</summary>
          <p>
            Transferable skills are also the core language of job profiles and
            job descriptions; employers sometimes call them competences. When
            learners have more familiarity with the language of transferable
            skills, they make job profiles more accessible and comprehensible.
            This can also open up new conversations about roles they might be
            interested in, but fear they are not suited for. Seeing that they
            are already using and developing key transferable skills for those
            roles in their everyday curriculum learning can really build
            confidence and a sense of purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could use job descriptions and role profiles to help learners
            see transferable skills from the employer point of view, and make
            connections with skills that are listed in SkillsMap® and developed
            in different subjects they are studying. Language may not match
            exactly, but the types of skills will be clear and recognisable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key to building that connection is helping everyone become more
            familiar with the language of transferable skills, and SkillsMap®
            can help you start exploring that language. You might also like to
            use the{' '}

            as a different way of introducing learners to the idea of different
            types of transferable skills that span different subjects. This map
            is based on the SkillsMap® taxonomy from which the 15 skills for
            each subject have been chosen.
